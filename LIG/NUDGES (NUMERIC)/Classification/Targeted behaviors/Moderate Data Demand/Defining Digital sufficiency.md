## Issue

>[!Note]
>**Taxonomy of first-order and higher-order environmental effects related to ICT :**
>- **First-order** or “**direct effects**” relate to **producing ICT devices** and infrastructures and to the **electricity demand** from using those digital devices and services.
>- **Higher-order** or “**indirect effects**” result from **social change** associated with **applying** and **using ICT**.
>  
> **Four mechanism that inhibit the realization of positive effects :**
> - “**direct effects**” (first-order) come with manifold environmental problems, includ- ing **extraction of scarce resources** and **insufficient environmental standards** within the **ICT production process**. ICT hardware production itself is far from living up to the premise of environmental consistency, which would imply that devices be  made of renewable resources or fully recycled materials in a circular economy.
> - Volume of data storage, processing, and transmission is currently increasing exponentially. Notwithstanding the fact that energy and resource efficiencies of data processing and transmission are constantly increasing.
> - **Hardware, software, and ICT system** management have become **more efficient**. Such efficiency improvements may help reduce existing environmental burdens, but at the same time, they also **generate rebound effects** (ppl consume more as prices go down), which countervail parts of the savings potential, if not all.
> - Introduction of ICT applications opens up **new opportunities for production** and **consumption** and, hence, leads to induction effects, which occur if ICT use generates **additional energy and resource demand**.

## Hardware sufficiency

>[!Definition]
>- Increasing ***hardware efficiency*** would aim either at **reducing the energy and material per production unit** of hardware or at increasing energy efficiency in the use phase to keep relative **energy demand per unit of computing power** at a **minimum**.
>- In contrast, ***hardware sufficiency aims at :***
>	- being able to **produce fewer devices**
>	- designing **devices that last** for a long time
>	- ensuring that their **complexity and resource use** do not **surpass the purpose** they are designed for ('not craking a nut with a sledge-hammer')
>	- **keeping** their absolute **energy demand** at **lowest level possible** to perform the desired tasks

>[!Important]
>**Hardware sufficiency can foster user sufficiency** (see below) whenever **manufacturers empower ICT buyers to improve how resources are used**. For instance, hardware producers can support **sufficiency-oriented use** by granting a “right to repair,” i.e., **allow users** to **hack digital locks on devices** in order to **repair those devices themselves**.
>

**Leads :**
- Policies should aim at **avoiding unnecessary early termination** of a hardware’s useful life :
	- manufacturers should **offer repair and upgrade services** and **provide necessary software updates** for operating systems until the end of a device’s physical lifetime.
	- hardware companies should **change their business models** from **selling** to **letting** (device-as-a-service), allowing devices that do not meet the requirements of the users to be returned and redistributed to other users after refurbishment.
	- **policies** should aim at **improving collection and recovery rates**, e.g., legislation should make **take-back programs mandatory**.

## Software sufficiency

>[!Definition]
>- Increasing ***software efficiency*** would aim at **reducing the demand for electricity** and **hardware utilization** per **unit of computing** power or data transmission.
>- In contrast, ***software sufficiency*** aims at software being developed so that **data  traffic** and **hardware utilization** during application are as **low as possible** in absolute terms.

>[!Important]
> **Software sufficiency** can **contribute to hardware sufficiency** if software products are designed to **run on older hardware**.
> **Software sufficiency** can also contribute to **user sufficiency** (see below) if **applications** actively help **users to reduce hardware and energy demand** and data traffic (via various default settings :
> 	- strict privacy settings
> 	- providing the minimal resolution appropriate for online video and pictures
> 	- erasing unnecessary data generated during operation
> 	- disabling further consumption-increasing nudges such as autoplay (see [[Dark patterns in Streaming Platforms]])).

**Leads : **
- **Default settings** towards **minimal energy demand** + **website** allowing access with **slow Internet connections**.
- Limiting the extent of forced connectivity.
- Applying open standards.
- Mitigating hardware obsolescence by ensuring backward compatibility.
- **Labels for energy sufficient software** can promote environmentally friendly solutions, create an awareness of sustainability issues among software developers, and help users choose between alternatives.

## User sufficiency

>[!Definition]
>From the user perspective, two aspects need to be distinguished: **how are ICT used** (number of devices, intensity, duration) and **what are ICT used for** (purpose, activity).
> ***User sufficiency*** has two goals: **using digital devices frugally** and **using ICT** that **promote sustainable lifestyles** and enable to reduce their consumption needs while maintaining a decent quality of life. 

**Leads**
- **Informational and educational campaigns** can increase knowledge of and awareness for the environmental impacts of hardware and software. -> *sustainability communication*
- **Nudges**

## Economic sufficiency


>[!Definition]
>- Increasing economic efficiency would aim at either **achieving a given economic output** with the **lowest possible energy and resource input** or **maximizing economic output** with **limited resource and energy input**.
>- In contrast, ***economic sufficiency*** aims at digitalization supporting a transition to an economy characterized not by economic growth as the primary goal but by production and consumption sufficient to serve existing societal and individual needs.

>[!Important]
>**Policies targeting economic sufficiency** mainly address **policymakers** at the **federal or communal level** in the fields of economic and labor policy, environmental policy, and firm regulation.

**Leads :**
- Rebound effects can be counteracted by increasing the costs of energy consumption.

### Actioning Moderate Internet Use

---

1. **Incorporating Moderate Internet Use into Business Models**

>[!IDEALLY]

-  Design applications and services that help users limit their Internet use.

- Create **responsible, ethical and sustainable designs**—utilising these aspects as a deliberative selling point to keep customers and profit.

- Moderate Internet use would be especially relevant for **bandwidth-intensive activities** such as **streaming content** (watching, listening), **social networking** and **online gaming**.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

**IMPORTANT**:

- **Currently:** it’s no secret that companies follow design patterns which intentionally facilitate ‘persuasive’ behaviours: (see also [[Dark patterns in Streaming Platforms]])
	1. motivate users to use the service 
	2. simplify the design to make it as easy to use as possible 
	3. introduce ‘triggers’ that push users to perform a specific behaviour in the moment

- Such designs may **hinder business profitability**.
	- For **example** : if Amazon were to avoid sending these ‘one click’ product emails, users are less likely to visit the site to purchase these items and therefore Amazon could potentially lose out on custom.

2. **Implementing Users’ Freedom of Choice**

>[!IDEALLY]

-> Moderations of users’ Internet use should only affect users in positive ways, i.e. **adapt Internet uses** when **users are happy for their Internet uses to be adapted**.

-> This requires sophisticated contextual awareness, meaning that Internet use should only be facilitated:
	1. At a **time suitable for the users**.
	2. At a **place** where **users can cope with Internet limits**.
	3. For **services** that do **not disrupt their necessary uses** of the Internet.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

**IMPORTANT**:

-> Finding the **balance between helping users** and **acting on their behalf** (e.g. limiting their use) is going to be **challenging**.
	-> **‘Cold Turkey’**, a software tool to block “time-wasting websites, games and applications”8 (e.g. at specific times or after a certain time limit has passed), **cannot be deactivated**;
	-> **StayFocusd**, a Chrome browser extension that blocks access to certain sites however, **can easily be bypassed** (e.g. by disabling the extension, or using an alternative browser such as Safari).

-> If the **moderating design** is **too easily ignored**, it will be **too easy** for participants to **revert to their usage norms**.

3. **Evaluating Moderate Internet Use Designs**

>[!Important]
>- Any design proposals must **clearly be tested** and **evaluated** with **end-users** to determine their **efficiency**, ideally for a sufficiently **long time** to understand genuine adoption.
>
>- Moderate Internet use tools could also **gather useful interaction** and **quantitative data** to aid in its evaluation.
>  
>- **Software based interventions** (ex: make smartphone vibrate when time limit of use is exceeded) are a **potentially effective way** of gathering longitudinal, largescale data from a wide audience. **BUT** **current restraints** that mobile operating systems place to preserve energy, ensure inter-application security and the privacy of user data, are making these types of **‘background’ software increasingly difficult to implement**.
>	- Only **specific types of apps can run continuously in the background** (e.g. music players, location trackers) on Apple’s iOS. Logging device actions and data demand in real-time is **no longer possible unless ‘disguised’ as a permitted background-execution app**.
>	- **Access and control of certain device settings** (e.g. turning off mobile data and Wi-Fi) to save upstream network demand is **restricted on Android and iOS** without breaking the standard operating systems protections.

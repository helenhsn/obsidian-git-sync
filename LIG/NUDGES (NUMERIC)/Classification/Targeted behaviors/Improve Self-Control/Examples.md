# Digital self-control interventions for distracting media multitasking - A systematic review


## Features presented

#### Awareness features

- [Computer program which displayed the most-used programs from the last 30 min to the participants, showing the most-frequently used programs larger than the less frequently used ones](Whittaker, S., Kalnikaite, V., Hollis, V., & Guydish, A. (2016, May 7). ‘Don't waste my time’: Use of time information improves focus. In _Proceedings of the 2016 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems_. San Jose, CA: Association for Computing Machinery. [https://doi.org/10.1145/2858036.2858193](https://doi.org/10.1145/2858036.2858193))

- [modified web browser to show statistics about the frequency of work versus non-work websites that the participants visited](Lottridge, D., Marschner, E., Wang, E., Romanovsky, M., & Nass, C. (2012). Browser design impacts multitasking. Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting, 56(1), 1957–1961. [https://doi.org/10.1177/1071181312561289](https://doi.org/10.1177/1071181312561289))

- Different kinds of notifications that alerted the participants: text messages#6, push notifications, and popup message dialogues.
	- [smartphone vibrations when a time quota for a distracting website (in their case, Facebook) was exceeded](Okeke, F., Sobolev, M., Dell, N., & Estrin, D. (2018). Good vibrations: Can a digital nudge reduce digital overload? In _Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction with Mobile Devices and Services –MobileHCI'18_. Barcelona, Spain: ACM Press. [https://doi.org/10.1145/3229434.3229463](https://doi.org/10.1145/3229434.3229463))
	-> The interventions informed the participants about the extent of distracting activity use except these following **2 exceptions**:
	- [The first exception were the SMS notifications in the intervention from Terry et al., which contained facts about the negative effects of media multitasking](Terry, C. A., Mishra, P., & Roseth, C. J. (2016). Preference for multitasking, technological dependency, student metacognition, & pervasive technology use: An experimental intervention. Computers in Human Behavior, 65, 241–251. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2016.08.009](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2016.08.009))
	- [Framing of the content, where all but one intervention focused on the distracting activities. To investigate the effect of a positive framing, Y.-H. Kim et al. used visualizations for the use of productive programs like word processors, and compared this with distraction-focused visualizations](Kim, Y.-H., Jeon, J. H., Choe, E. K., Lee, B., Kim, K., & Seo, J. (2016, May 7). TimeAware: Leveraging framing effects to enhance personal productivity. In _Proceedings of the 2016 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems_. San Jose, CA: ACM. [https://doi.org/10.1145/2858036.2858428](https://doi.org/10.1145/2858036.2858428))

#### Goal-advancement features

- The majority of the interventions with goal-advancement features asked the participant to set a time limit for their distracting activities.

- To sanction goal deviations, the interventions used blocking of distractions, repeated reminders or the reduction of a virtual score.

- **Three different interaction lockout mechanisms (ILM):**
	- **Non-ILM** condition: users received only notifications that reminded them of their time limit.
	- **Weak-ILM** condition: the participants' phones were locked for increasing durations
	- **Strong-ILM** condition: locked the users' phones for the rest of the day after exceeding their time limit goal


#### Blocking Features

- [Blocked distractions during work time with the ’freedom’ software, a blacklist-based website blocker](Mark, G., Czerwinski, M., & Iqbal, S. T. (2018). Effects of individual differences in blocking workplace distractions. In _Proceedings of the 2018 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems – CHI'18_. Montreal, Canada: ACM Press. [https://doi.org/10.1145/3173574.3173666](https://doi.org/10.1145/3173574.3173666))

- [Pomodoro-timer intervention on the usage of distracting websites. In the Pomodoro method, users set a time interval (typically 25 min), during which they plan to work productively](Kim, J., Cho, C., & Lee, U. (2017). Technology supported behavior restriction for mitigating self-interruptions in multi-device environments. In Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies (Vol. 1(3), pp. 64:1–64:21). Association for Computing Machinery. [https://doi.org/10.1145/3130932](https://doi.org/10.1145/3130932))

- [Website-blocking system with a chatbot to control a time-based blocking system for the transition from break to work](Tseng, V. W.-S., Lee, M. L., Denoue, L., & Avrahami, D. (2019). Overcoming distractions during transitions from break to work using a conversational website-blocking system, In _Proceedings of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems – CHI'19_. Glasgow, UK: ACM Press. [https://doi.org/10.1145/3290605.3300697](https://doi.org/10.1145/3290605.3300697))
	- A break was operationalized as an absence of user input for at least 5 min. Upon resumption of work, the chatbot was activated and started disabling access to distracting websites for the next 25 min. The participants could negotiate a lift of the block by navigating through a conversation with the chatbot. The chatbot also suggested to start blocking sessions when a participant spent more than 15 min on distracting websites

- **Lock n' Type**

#### Modification of content

- Modify certain aspects of a digital distraction to make it **still usable, but less appealing** to the participants.

- Remove non-essential parts of the distraction that are typically designed to convince the users to spend more time with an app or a website.

- [Switched their participants' smartphone displays to grayscale#14 in order to reduce gratification from distracting activities. The grayscale filter was an integrated feature of their participants' smartphones, and the filter was active at all times and for all apps.](Holte, A. J., & Ferraro, F. R. (2020). True colors: Grayscale setting reduces screen time in college students. The Social Science Journal, 1–17. [https://doi.org/10.1080/03623319.2020.1737461](https://doi.org/10.1080/03623319.2020.1737461))
- [Web browser tab bar so that tabs that were classified as work-related had their colour contrast enhanced, and were made larger. Tabs from non-work URLs were made smaller and always displayed on the right](Lottridge, D., Marschner, E., Wang, E., Romanovsky, M., & Nass, C. (2012). Browser design impacts multitasking. Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting, 56(1), 1957–1961. [https://doi.org/10.1177/1071181312561289](https://doi.org/10.1177/1071181312561289))
- [’Habitlab’, a browser extension that rotates behaviour change interventions for distracting websites, that is, the participants experienced different interventions between visits to the same site](Kovacs, G., Wu, Z., & Bernstein, M. S. (2018). Rotating online behavior change interventions increases effectiveness but also increases attrition. Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction, 2, 1–25. [https://doi.org/10.1145/3274364](https://doi.org/10.1145/3274364)) -> news feed blocker for Facebook, or hiding ’related videos' on YouTube.
- [Browser extension to remove the newsfeed#16b from the Facebook homepage.](Lyngs, U., Lukoff, K., Slovak, P., Seymour, W., Webb, H., Jirotka, M., Van Kleek, M., & Shadbolt, N. (2020). ‘I just want to hack myself to not get distracted’: Evaluating design interventions for self-control on facebook. _arXiv:2001.04180 [cs]_, arxiv 2001.04180.

#### Reward and punishment

- [Ko et al. 2015](Ko, M., Yang, S., Lee, J., Heizmann, C., Jeong, J., Lee, U., Shin, D., Yatani, K., Song, J., & Chung, K.-M. (2015, February 28). NUGU: A group-based intervention app for improving self-regulation of limiting smartphone use. In _Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work & Social Computing_. Vancouver, Canada: Association for Computing Machinery. [https://doi.org/10.1145/2675133.2675244](https://doi.org/10.1145/2675133.2675244)) added social support and point reward features to their ’NUGU’ smartphone app. The participants were asked to specify a duration for which they wanted to stop using their smartphone (e.g., ‘studying for 30 minutes’). These limiting sessions were conceptualized as ‘missions’, and completing a mission gave the users virtual points. If a participant used the smartphone for anything except incoming calls, the mission failed. Participants could also form groups, start missions together, and compare their time-limiting efforts with those of their peers

# Reducing Risk in Digital Self-Control Tools (DSCT): Design Paterns and  Prototype

### Proposed Design Patterns

>[!Continuously Variable Interventions]
>

-> **Conscious interventions**, such as those that **intentionally remove elements**, **show notifcations**, or block sitesâ€”may be effective, but may also cause negative feelings in users, such as  **feelings of helplessness or annoyance** (therefore increasing the risk of abandonment)

-> **Solution: interventions that are continuously variable** , or that **can be scaled** from a level of 0 (of) to a level of progressively higher effectiveness.
	-> remove some suggestions  instead of the full sidebar of suggestions
	-> use delays before blocks
	-> smaller notifcations instead of larger notifcations

>[!Anti-Aging Design]

-> DSCTs that **block elements or change them** are particularly vulnerable to ***software aging***, considered to be the **natural degradation of software capabilities**, often due to **changes in their technical environment**.
-> These concerns contribute to the inherent risk taken on by DSCTs as a part of their software development.

- **DSCTs can reduce risk** on these axes by **consolidating their approaches** (choosing the simplest method to fulfll an approach) or by **adding redundancy to their approaches** (choosing multiple equivalent methods to support a single goal).


>[!Obligatory Bundling of Interventions]

-> To reduce risk of the failure of one particular intervention, a DSCT could instead **obligate users** to adopt a **bundle of interventions**, instead of allowing a user to adopt a **single intervention alone**.

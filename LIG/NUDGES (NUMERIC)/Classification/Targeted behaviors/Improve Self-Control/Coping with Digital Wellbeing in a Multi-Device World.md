While Digital Self-Control Tools (DSCTs) mainly target **smartphones**, more effort **should** be put into evaluating **multi-device ecosystems** to enhance digital well being as users typically use multiple devices at a time. In this paper, the authors reviewed more than 300 DSCTs by demonstrating that the majority of them implements a single-device conceptualization that poorly adapts to multi-device settings.
Their findings show that digital well being issues **extend beyond smartphones**, with the **most problematic behaviors deriving from the simultaneous usage of different devices** to perform uncorrelated tasks.

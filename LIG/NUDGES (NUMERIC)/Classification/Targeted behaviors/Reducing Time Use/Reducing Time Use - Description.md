# Reducing time use
>[! INFO]
> This category of nudges contains devices that mostly aim to reduce the time each user spend on their personal devices (phones, computers...). 


>[! LINK TO OUR SUBJECT]
> At first glance, these type of nudges (mostly apps) aim to overcome people's bad habits regarding the use of their technological devices (ex : spending too much time each day just navigating on social media) and to increase their productivity. Except some exceptions (*Forest?*), their goal at the first place isn't ecological-related.
> 	**However**, reducing the time we're spending on our technological devices implies a reduced consumption of data also. The link with the environmental cause is therefore implicit but still is worthy of attention.

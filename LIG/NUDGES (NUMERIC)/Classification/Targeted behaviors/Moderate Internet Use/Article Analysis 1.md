# Mapping the Scope of Software Interventions for Moderate Internet Use on Mobile Devices
> [!Description]
> There are increasing concerns about the negative impacts that these services and devices have on the very users that access these technologies, such as issues of addiction and mental wellbeing (see [[Reducing Time Use - Description]])
> Coinciding with these are **environmental concerns** over the rate of **growth in Internet connectivity** and the **resources needed** to **power the Internet** infrastructure, with ICT expected to grow to about **21% of our global electricity**  
consumption by 2030.

>[!Notes]
>The need to decrease the demand for Internet data and use is particularly relevan for **smartphones**. The traffic consumption from these devices is expected to **grow, increasing 10 times** for mobile data between 2016–2022 and forming 50% of total global Internet traffic by 2022 (growing from 23% in 2017).
>	Smartphones are the **most commonly used device** composing 68% of the total time people spend online, with mobile devices forming 75% of time online once tablets are considered.

>[!Conclusion]
>Given the complexities of this work, we have offered two ways forward for mobile operating providers
>	1) to continue as a **closed system**, leaving the control for embedding data demand reductions in the **hands of companies** such as Google and Apple
>	2) to make this **space more open-source**, ensuring **clear and ethical use of moderate Internet** use **interventions** through **more transparent API information**, Internet manipulation features, and access permissions

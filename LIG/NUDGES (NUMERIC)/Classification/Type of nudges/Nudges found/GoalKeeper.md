# GoalKeeper : Exploring Interaction Lockout Mechanisms for Regulating Smartphone Use

## Description

>[!PRINCIPLE]
>a smartphone intervention app that locks the user into the self-defined daily use time limit with restrictive intervention mechanisms.

They conducted a four-week field experiment with 36 participants to investigate the effects and user experiences of varying intensities of restrictive interventions.

The results showed that **restrictive mechanisms are more effective than non-restrictive** mechanisms *such as warning*.

>[!ATTENTION]
However, we found that restrictive mechanisms caused **more frustration and pressure to the users**, mainly due to *diversity of usage contexts and needs*.

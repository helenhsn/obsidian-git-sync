#### Classification of Dark Patterns (Nudges)

##### Feature Fog

>[!Definition]
>**Induce unawareness** by reducing autonomy of monitoring user time spent. 
>These UI patterns are designed so that the **user is less able to get feedback on time spent** engaged in a viewing session.

-> Cf [[Leads to reduce Data Demand 3]]

##### Extreme countdown

>[!Definition]
> Refers to UI patterns that **have a timer** and that **execute automatically if not interrupted** within the short period of time.
> Such patterns cause unintended behaviors of over-watching : reduce user autonomy in making conscious decisions, especially as time increases in a video watching session.
> Though such a pattern is useful when watching the desired content, it is also responsible for enforcing a sunk cost fallacy when users have invested some time in something that they might not necessarily even enjoy watching.
> ex : *Autoplay in Netflix*

>[!Important]
>Participants suggested that there should be more **degree of freedom** in timer-countdown related features by incorporating **accessible settings** to **turn off** those features or **customize the timer duration**.


##### Switch off delay

>[!Definition]
>UI patterns that promote strategies of **hiding restrictive usage features** in the **default** UI.
>ex : *Log out feature not readily available on many platforms* : participants pointed how they have been discouraged to log out due to the unavailability of logout on the main landing page.

##### Attention quicksand

>[!Definition]
> UI patterns that **instantly start** without **conscious user action**. They instantly **grab user attention** and **divert them** from what could otherwise be a different online behavior.
> ex : *instant GIF starter on video thumbnails upon mouse hover or single touch scroll on mobile devices.* OR *Trailers of popular shows/movies starting automatically on Netflix*

>[!Important]
> These platforms use the power of **animated visual content** consumed through the path of least cognitive resistance that causes **instant gratifcation** through a simple hover interaction.
> Participants wish for a **more conscious interaction method** instead  
of videos starting automatically.

#####  Bias grind

>[!Definition]
>Refers to UI patterns that **disproportionately overload user interests and biases**.
>ex : *choice overload -> providing an infnitely long scroll of Recommendations based on previous watching history*.

>[!Important]
>Recommendation features **enable compulsiveness**, especially as the **viewing time of a session increases**. Provides **so many options** that sometimes users fall into an endless list of irrelevant videos.

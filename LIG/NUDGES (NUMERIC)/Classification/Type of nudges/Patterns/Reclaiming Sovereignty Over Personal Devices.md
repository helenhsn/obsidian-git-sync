>The very mobile apps that now enable people to do so much are **also being used as leverage by app developers**, platforms, and services to exploit end-users, as evidenced by an increasing variety of user-hostile elements situated within services that provide this essential digital functionality. Such exploitation ranges from behavioral design (nudging people to take certain actions, such as making systems addictive), to exploiting users’ psychological weaknesses, to features that directly **harm the user** such as by **undermining their privacy** either by giving up their personal information directly or by tracking them behind the scenes.

This article explores how one specific example of user hostile design in mobile apps, namely dark patterns.

The authors made a tool **GreaseMonkey** that lets users choose from a wide array of user scripts to change the design or functionality of a given website to fit their needs.

This other [paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3173574.3174108) provide a classification of dark patterns :
	* **Interface Interference** : manipulate the user interface such that certain actions are induced upon the user compared to other possible actions.
	* **Nagging** : interrupt the user’s current task with out-of-focus tasks, usually in the form of a choice-based popup to redirect a user towards another goal.
	* **Forced Action** : introduce sub-tasks forcefully before permitting a user to complete their desired task.
	* **Obstruction** : introduce sub tasks with the intention of dissuading a user from performing an operation in the desired mode.
	* **Sneaking** : elements conceal or delay information relevant to the user in performing a task.

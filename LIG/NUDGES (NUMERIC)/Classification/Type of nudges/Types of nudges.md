#### Nudges patterns
![[Patterns.png]]

##### Social nudges
>[!Definition]
>This nudge guides the user’s behavior by pro-viding references to how other users behave, thereby creating a social norm.

##### Reinforcement nudges
>[!Definition]
>These nudges reinforce behaviors and choices by increasing their salience in the mind of the user.

##### Disclosure nudges
>[!Definition]
>As a nudge, disclosure entails adding informa-tion that is accessible, clear, and relevant to the choice that the user is about to make.

##### Friction nudges
>[!Definition]
>A behavior can be encouraged or discouraged by removing or adding friction respectively.
>Explanation : 
>- **removing friction** : the easier you can make a task, the greater the likelihood someone will complete it). By removing obstacles that can get in the way of an individual’s best intentions, organizations can encourage better choices and help individuals to act on their desired behaviors (ex : [[LIG/NUDGES (NUMERIC)/Classification/Type of nudges/Nudges found/MyTime]] helps users self-regulate their smartphone app use over time)
> - **adding friction** : opposite.

##### Feedback nudges
>[!Definition]
>See [[ECO-FEEDBACKS]] section.

##### Default nudges
>[!Definition]
>Defaults are perhaps the **most well-known** and **most effective pattern** for nudging. The idea of a default nudge is to design the choice architecture in such a way that the **default behavior** is the **desired behavior**.
>ex : **organ donation enrollment policy** -> changing from a default set to non-donor with a possibility to explicitly opt in, to a default set to donor with a possibility to opt out.

##### Warning nudges
>[!Definition]
> Different kinds of warnings and graphics as-sist users by grabbing their attention to various risks or consequences. Warning nudges can help protect user privacy by raising potential unwanted data disclosure on social media.

##### Scarcity nudges
>[!Definition]
>People assign **more value** to something that is going to be **more difficult to acquire in the future**.
>ex : “only one room left” on hotel booking platforms.

##### Deception nudges
>[!Definition]
> Affect how choice alternatives are perceived by users.
> ex : adding a decoy option to the choice architecture. A decoy option is an option that will not be selected by the user, but that steers their choice to one specifc alternative. (ex : products A, B with priceB>priceA and adding product C which is worse than B and as expensive will increase B appeal as its objectively way better than C).

##### Commitment nudges
>[!Definition]
>The idea of this pattern is that when com-mitments are elicited from the user, they will motivate the user to behave in a way that is consistent with those previous commitments.
>ex : a combination of commitment and social nudges can led to more energy-saving choices

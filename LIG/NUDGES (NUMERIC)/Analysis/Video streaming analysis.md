>**It is estimated that IP video traffic will further increase to 82% of then 4.75 ZB global IP traffic by 2022.**

>[!Analysis of IP traffic]
> It was estimated that **60% of global data traffic can be attributed to online video** and – further divided – to Video on Demand (20% of global data traffic), Tubes such as YouTube (13% of global data traffic), pornographic videos (17% of global data traffic) and online video from social networks and other webpages (11% of global data traffic) (Cf [this review](https://theshiftproject.org/en/article/unsustainable-use-online-video/))


### Results of an online survey (N=97 participants)

- The survey showed that overall, participants had streamed  **1.77 hours per day**.
- They had streamed **more on weekends** than on weekdays.
- Users streamed less in the morning, afternoon and at night than in the evening.
- **SmartTV** is the **more consuming** (regarding device production, data traffic and operational electricity demand). **Smartphone** is the **less consuming**.


### Suggestions for improvement

- Streaming providers can adjust default settings for resolution
- Politics have to adjust the system of energy labels of TVs and establish a right to repair on electronic products.  
- Representative surveys are necessary to further identify determinants for environmentally relevant online video streaming behavior.

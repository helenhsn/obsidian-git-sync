 # Digitalisation, energy and data demand: The impact of Internet traffic on overall and peak electricity consumption

Subjects targeted : #DataConsumptionAnalysis

>[!Keywords]
> Internet, Infrastructures, Peak electricity demand, Digital technologies, Social practices, Time-use

>[!Essential]
>Even for the most straightforward effect, **direct consumption**, there has been **considerable variance in results**, with different methods yielding very different estimates of how much energy the Internet uses, and **what the consumption attributable to a MB of data traffic might be**.


>[!Important]
>The energy research community has largely focused on the direct consumption of (consumer) products and a limited range of effects in other areas of consumption, including the potentials and pitfalls of smart energy technologies. However, this is only part of the story when it comes to energy demand associated with ICT.

>[!Important]
>  The energy implications are often categorised into orders of effects, where **first order** effects are the **energy used directly to produce and use ICT**, **secondary effects** are the **immediate consequences for other forms of environmental impacts** (such as changes in travel) and **tertiary effects** are the **ongoing changes as ICT is used over time**, leading to other adjustments, changes and innovations

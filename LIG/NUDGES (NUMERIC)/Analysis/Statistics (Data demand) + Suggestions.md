#### Notes

##### Watching Demand in the Home

>[!Important]
>The services used for this activity (e.g. YouTube, Netflix etc.) contributed  
to **72%** (558.57 GB) of the households’ total data demand  (777.09 GB). This activity typically occured every day of the week (figure 1). There were peaks **early morning** (07:00) and **late at night** (22:00), with an **early evening peak** at 18:00.

>[!Important]
>YouTube is used by all of the households and was found to be the **largest contributor to data demand**—consuming 49.25% of demand for watching across all house-holds (275.12 GB / 558.57 GB).

>[!Important]
>Factors that increase data demand : 
>- Watching **separate content via different mediums at the same time** (e.g. through broadcast TV, on-demand services, DVDs etc.)
>- The **variety of devices available** has created new possibilities for how and when watching can be carried out.
>- Media-multitasking : leading to the accomplishment of other activities whilst the TV is on. Many users access their mobile devices whilst watching TV for both “media-meshing” i.e. **interaction involving the TV program in view**, and “media-stacking” i.e. **interaction for other means unrelated to the TV**.

##### Suggested solutions (HCI)

- The emergence of **smart home devices** could be used to combat the associated demand: users’ **current Internet activities** could be shared or **made more visible** (through displays, apps, or dis-aggregated views) in the household.
- **Media-multitasking** could be omitted by prompting users to choose between watching and the secondary activity.
- **Multi-watching** could be removed by bringing household members together for group-only streaming.

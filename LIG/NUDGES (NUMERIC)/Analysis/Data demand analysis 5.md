# Demand Around the Clock: Time Use and Data Demand of Mobile Devices in Everyday Life

>[!Important]
>The time use of applications on mobile devices has been extensively studied in prior work :
>- **Average duration of use** for an application lasts only **72 seconds**, yet the average use of devices totals to **59 minutes per day**.
>- **Interactions with devices** have been found to range from **10–250 seconds**, with **each session** more likely to be for a **new interaction** rather than for following up a previous interaction.
>- **How users revisit their smartphones** and applications.
>- **Users’ attention span** for web **browsing** on mobile phones within **different contexts**.
>- Identifying different yet **common patterns of smartphone users**.
>- Exploring the **differences of smartphone usage sessions** in various places.

>[!Goal]
>Not to characterise use of such devices, but rather to **quantify the data demand and associated energy impact** from the everyday practices of users.
>**Establish the data demand** relating to **everyday practices** that involve **mobile devices**. We identify the most data (and thus associated energy) intensive practices (e.g. watching, listening and social networking) at a level finer than surveyed in existing work.

>[!Study Sample]
>Quantitative exploration of **398 participants’ logs** of mobile device use, correlated with detailed accounts of how time use and data demand relate to **practices for 8 participants**.


>[!Important]
>Apps and services relating directly to **updates and backups accounted for 7%** of the participants’ **daily aggregate data demand**.
>A demand that arises in the following scenarios:
>- (1) updating an app or the OS
>- (2) downloading new apps from the app store
>- (3) syncing and backing up of data to a server or Cloud service


#### Targeted app categories for data demand reduction

- Watching (21%)
- Listening (11%)
- Social networking (8%)
- Background processes (10%)

>[!Important]
>The **demand for watching and listening** is still **significant** during non-waking hours (02:00–06:00); this shows that the data demand for these categories **may not always necessarily be triggered by users**, or **may continue when they are asleep**.

>[!Important]
>Social apps are used less frequently (4.77% total app launches) than communication apps (49.5%).
>-> BUT : category of social networking leads to significantly higher energy demand than communication, and does so consistently throughout the day.
>-  Due to : rich media increasingly designed into social apps, such as **picture-enhanced feeds** and the **auto-playing of shared videos** and **adverts**.

>[!Solutions]

- ***Social apps:*
	- **Slow design** : recuding media previews or increasing the number of access levels to such content.
- ***Communication apps:
	- **Simple SMS texting** + **Switching communication methods**
- ***Video streaming*:
	- coordinating with others to **enjoy programmes together**
	- **listening to locally-stored or cached music**
	- developing **special,** **celebratory times** (weekly or monthly) to more fully appreciate **streamed media**, rather than binge-watching.

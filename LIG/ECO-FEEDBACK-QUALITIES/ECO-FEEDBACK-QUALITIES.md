## Eco-Feedback qualities

This paper is also articulated around three general **eco-feedback qualities** that "*respond* " to these behavioural mechanisms : 
	- [[Salience]]
	- [[Precision]]
	- [[Meaning]]

>[!DEFINITION]
**Salience** refers to how well eco-feedback *captures attention*, i.e., enters the userâ€™s *awareness*
>
**Precision** refers to the precision of the programmed *relation* between parameters of responding and parameters of the resulting consequences
>
>**Meaning** refers to how *comprehensible* and  
*worthwhile* eco-feedback is *to the user*; aspects of eco-feedback design  
that provide or enhance meaning impact motivation, i.e., the degree to  
which feedback functions as a reinforcer for target behavior

### Type of modality

##### Description
> Special class of modality. Provides information via **subtle, aesthetically pleasing changes** that can be absorbed while a user is attenting to another task.

> Ambient displays tend to **reduce information [[Granularity]]** so the user can **understand it from the periphery of their perception** (via varying the salience of the display accroding to the varying importance of different information provided = **notification levels**).

> Ambient eco-feedback seems to be effective regarding **energy savings**, load shiftings, increased awareness of energy use.

> **Examples** : on-board vehicle eco-driving feedback displays, in-home energy feedback monitors. Use the symbolic red/yellow/green color scheme (reduced granularity) through more creative designs.


##### Notes
> Ambient modalities are highly salient, thus **minimizing disruption** (as the feedback is accessible without actually paying directly attention to it), but are **low granularity**, thus lacking capacity for detail.

# Eco-feedback classification
See this [article](https://cloud.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/s/2Bm5iiQrwyW7GNf?dir=undefined&path=%2FPrincipes%20de%20l%27%C3%A9co-feedback&openfile=497438896)

>[!DEFINITION]
**Eco-feedback** is information about resource (energy, water, food) consumption provided back to consumer(s)  with the *goal* of promoting more *sustainable* behavior.

As scientists realized, the way the information are shared is a key element to change users behaviour. Indeed, some experiences have shown that it can even lead to the opposite desired behaviour.

>[!ATTENTION]
>**Effective** eco-feedback relies upon an understanding of  *key eco-feedback design* dimensions and how they relate to *behavior change*. 

## General behavioral mechanisms

According to this [paper](https://cloud.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/s/2Bm5iiQrwyW7GNf?dir=undefined&path=%2FPrincipes%20de%20l%27%C3%A9co-feedback&openfile=497438896), eco-feedback can be **effective** on thos three **general behavioral mechanisms** :
	 - Attention
	 - Learning
	 - Motivation

>[!DEFINITION]
**Attention** refers to the response of attending to or perceiving  
some stimulus, including types of *voluntary* and *involuntary* attention.
>
**Learning** refer to associative learning processes, which involves stimulus control and re-  
inforcement of behavior via *consequences*.
>
>**Motivation** is referring to any event that makes a behavioral consequence *more* or *less* *reinforcing*

## Eco-Feedback qualities

This paper is also articulated around three general **eco-feedback qualities** that "*respond* " to these behavioural mechanisms : 
	- Salience
	- Precision
	- Meaning

>[!DEFINITION]
**Salience** refers to how well eco-feedback *captures attention*, i.e., enters the userâ€™s *awareness*
>
**Precision** refers to the precision of the programmed *relation* between parameters of responding and parameters of the resulting consequences
>
>**Meaning** refers to how *comprehensible* and  
*worthwhile* eco-feedback is *to the user*; aspects of eco-feedback design  
that provide or enhance meaning impact motivation, i.e., the degree to  
which feedback functions as a reinforcer for target behavior

## Eco-Feedback design dimensions

The author analysis yielded three types of **eco-feedback design dimensions** :
	- [[INFORMATION]]
	- [[DISPLAY]]
	- [[TIMING]]

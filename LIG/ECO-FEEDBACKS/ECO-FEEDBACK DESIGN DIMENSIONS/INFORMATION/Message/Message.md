### Message

###### Subsection of [[INFORMATION]]

**Message** describes the particular content of eco-feedback.

It is separated into three dimensions :
	- [[Metrics]]
	- [[Valence]]
	- [[Contextual information]]

>[!PERTINENCE]
These dimensions pertain to how data is **framed** for the user, and they have implications for **how meaningful** the user **perceives** the feedback to be, and thus their motivation for responding to it

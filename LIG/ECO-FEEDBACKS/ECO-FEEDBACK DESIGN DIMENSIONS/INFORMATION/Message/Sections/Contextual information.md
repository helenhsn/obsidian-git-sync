- *What is the context of the eco-feedback?*

>[!PERTINENCE]
According to Feedback Intervention Theory (FIT)), feedback can **regulate behavior** by allowing  **comparison of performance to a standard**. Eco-feedback often  includes a feedback standard.
> 
 > In the context of home energy  feedback, Fischer noted that “comparisons may **stimulate specific  motives** for energy conservation, for example, a **sense of competition**  and **ambition**.... They also **make transparent** whether consumption in a  certain period or of a certainhousehold is “**out of the norm**”, thereby  capturing the consumer’s attention, **alerting** him to a **potential** problem  and **activating** the search for reasons and redress”

There are **several types** of standards that can be provided in eco-feedback, including :
 - [[Historical Context]] 
 - [[Social Context]]
 - [[Goal Context]]

>[!INFO]
>In a rigorous meta-analysis of home energy feedback studies, Karlin et al. found  
that **goal** comparisons were most effective, followed by **historical**  
comparisons, then **social** comparisons.

### Historical
Historical or self-comparisons enable comparison of an individual’s or group’s current or  recent behavior to their past behavior, e.g., this month’s energy consumption compared to last month, an average month, or the same  month of the previous year. 

>[!INFO]
>In terms of historical comparisons, Pierce et al. noted that they can create a perception of baseline as goal, so the user does not aspire to consumption reductions, but is  pleased just to maintain the status quo. 

>[!ATTENTION]
>Furthermore, Froehlich noted that historical comparisons as feedback standards can become progressively more difficult to attain if performance improves over time.

### Social
Social, normative, or peer comparison, sometimes called benchmarking, presents an individual’s or group’s performance compared to the performance of comparable individuals or groups. 

>[!ATTENTION]
>In terms of social comparisons, research has shown that, while **underperforming** compared to peers can **motivate** improvement, **outperforming** peers can be a **disincentive** to improvement. 

### Goal
Goal comparisons enable consumers to compare their performance to a target or optimal standard. Other contextual data can serve as a feedback standard even if it is not explicitly framed as a goal.

>[!EXAMPLE]
> Estimated fuel economy for a vehicle or expected driving range.

>[!ATTENTION] 
>An important consideration is the **size** and **direction** of the feedback standard gap, i.e., the difference between performance and standard. Research suggests moderately difficult, but achievable goals, e.g., a performance-standard gap of 15% in one study, are more effective than goals that are too easy or too difficult

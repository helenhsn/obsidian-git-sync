- *Is the eco-feedback displayed with direct/accurate or 'motivating' measurements?*

### Metrics actions

##### Sientific metrics
Direct and accurate measurements **enable** **objective analysis** of the facts. When educating consumers about the actual mechanics of resource consumption is a goal of eco-feedback the designer would want to include direct measures of resource consumption in scientific units.

However, there are two main reasons to consider other types of metrics: 
	- Consumers may not understand scientific metrics
	-  Direct and  scientific metrics may not motivate consumers to engage with ecofeedback.

Direct metrics of resource consumption also **may not motivate** behavior change if they do not convey **personal consequences** of behavior.  

##### Simplified Metrics
Cost is a classic example of **translating consumption into a motivating metric**; however, if monetary amounts presented in eco-feedback are negligible they may actually be a disincentive to reduce consumption. Metrics that increase consumersâ€™ awareness of the consequences of their **behavior** for their **community** (e.g., air pollution) or the environment (e.g., global warming) may motivate behavior change by activating **moral norms**.


There is a **distinction** between direct, scientific metrics to  promote an **accurate** understanding of resource processes and *metaphorical* or *emotionally* evocative metrics to **persuade consumers that the information is meaningful** and thus motivate behavior change. 

Since knowledge of resource processes and motivational factors **vary widely among consumers** , it is *important to understand* the target consumer or community when determining metrics. **Providing multiple metrics** and/or allowing for customization are **promising strategies**.

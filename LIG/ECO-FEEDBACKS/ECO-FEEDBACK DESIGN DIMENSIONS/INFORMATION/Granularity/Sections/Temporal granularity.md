- *Is the eco-feedback displaying instant behavior or long-time period behavior?*

>[!DEFINITION]
>**Temporal granularity** refers to the time period reflected in eco-feedback data.
> It has two main levels: **instantaneous** or **accumulated** over some duration (e.g.,  
interval-by-interval performance data, average levels, or accumulating  
totals).

>[!ATTENTION]
>Temporal granularity does not necessarily directly reflect the  
duration of the target behavior.

>[!EXAMPLE]
For example, a home energy monitor *might* display **real-time** power demand in the home, e.g., in  watts or cost per hour. The user may glance at the feedback whilesitting in the living room watching television, after having started the  dishwasher and electric dryer several minutes earlier. The feedback will  be **reflecting instantaneous consumption** but the relevant behaviors  include momentary behaviors that occurred in the recent **past** (the  discrete acts of starting the dishwasher and dryer) and the **ongoing**,  prolonged behavior of watching television.

# Data granularity

##### Question related
- *Does the data reflect precisely the behavior?*

>[!DEFINITION]
>**Data granularity** is the resolution  of information conveyed, which corresponds to the amount of levels, or differentiation provided, in the data.

 >[!EXAMPLE]
 **Numeric data** typically have **high** data granularity, whereas  a **light that changes colors** between green, yellow, and red has **low** data  
granularity.

## Effects

When feedback reflects **very small increases and decreases** in  the magnitude of target behavior it is more *precise* and thus more  *supportive* for *learning* new or complex behaviors.  However, ambient displays **often call** for reduced data granularity  so that information can be absorbed **while** the user is attending to some  other task. See [[Modality]].

When combined with *high salience*, *low granularity* feedback can **call attention** to a **few important**  levels of information, which **might trigger further investigation**, at  which point *higher granularity* feedback could be *provided* to support  learning.

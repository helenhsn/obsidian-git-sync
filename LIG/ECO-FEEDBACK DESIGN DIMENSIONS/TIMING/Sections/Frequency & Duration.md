### Frequency & Duration
###### Subsection of [[TIMING]]

##### Question related
- *How often is feedback presented/updated and for how long (to the audience) ?*

> [!DEFINITION]
> We use the term frequency to refer to the frequency with which  
feedback is updated, i.e., not when it is available (e.g., daily feedback  
could be continuously available).

>[!DEFINITION] Definition floue
>Frequency is closely related to the **duration** of feedback presentation.  
For example, the term continuous can describe both frequency and  
duration–feedback updated and presented continuously, i.e., real-time.

Energy feedback research suggests that frequent feedback is **preferred** and **more effective** compared to less frequent feedback. 

Similar to immediate and granular feedback, frequent feedback is generally **more likely to reveal** the **impacts** of target behavior, as it enables the user to **identify changes** in feedback that may relate to their behavior.


>[!ATTENTION] 
>Theoretically, highly data granular feedback that updates frequently, such that the information is changing rapidly, could overwhelm users’cognitive resources. It is also possible that frequent feedback could become tedious or routine such that users stop attending to it

>[!ATTENTION]
>Duration of feedback presentation has received less attention likely because eco-feedback technologies are often available on demand (e.g., web-based and mobile apps)

# Strategic timing
###### Subsection of [[TIMING]]

##### Question related 
- *At what specific time is feedback presented/updated?*

> [!DEFINITION]
Feedback presentation can occur at strategic times, when consumers  
are most able or likely to attend to and respond to it, rather than  
continuously/on-demand or at regular intervals.

> [!EXAMPLE] 
> - Households might prefer to have eco-feedback accompany their utility bills or  
to receive it when something has changed.
> - Present feedback only contingent on the target behavior, e.g., a shower meter that is only activated when the shower is running or haptic feedback (i.e., counter-pressure) from an accelerator pedal when it is pressed

This is a very natural arrangement that makes good sense from a behavioral perspective as it makes the connection between behavior and feedback  quite clear.

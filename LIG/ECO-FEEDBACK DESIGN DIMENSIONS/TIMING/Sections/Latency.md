> [!DEFINITION]
Latency refers to the immediacy of eco-feedback after the target  
behavior.

Similar to highly granular feedback, **immediate** (or concurrent) feedback is more precisely related to the target behavior than delayed feedback. 
Immediate eco-feedback can best support learning, and is especially important when target behaviors are **new or complex**. 
Simple behaviors may be easily acquired despite delays in feedback.

## Immediate feedback

Similar to highly granular feedback, **immediate** (or concurrent) feedback is more precisely related to the target behavior than delayed feedback. 
Immediate eco-feedback can best support learning, and is especially important when target behaviors are **new or complex**. 


## Delayed feedback

Simple behaviors may be easily acquired despite delays in feedback.

Delayed feedback may be temporally too far removed to function as reinforcement for the target behavior, i.e., unable to support **basic** learning processes. However, delayed feedback can support reflection and thus **trigger a more complex** learning process.

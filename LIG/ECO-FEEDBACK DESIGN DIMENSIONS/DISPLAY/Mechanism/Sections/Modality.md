- *What is the perceptual mode of interface ?*

##### Notes
> Relates to the perceptual mode of interface. The **predominant mode** of eco-feedback is **[[Visual]]**, but there are some excellent examples regarding **[[Auditory]]** and **[[Tactile]]** eco-feedbacks.
> No examples regarding **[[taste]]** and **[[smell]]** eco-feedbacks.
> **[[Tactile]]**, **[[Highly interactive]]** and **[[Ambient]]** visual ecofeedbacks are categorized as experiential. **[[Tangible]]** eco-feedback is largely unexplored.

> **An optimal modality choice depends on the possibility of disruption and the need for detail**. 

>  Research suggests the value of employing **multiple modes of information delivery** (i.e. not just one type of modality) that tap into **multiple senses** and allow individual users to access information according to their preferences. (ex : visual and haptic force feedback for eco-driving more effective than either alone).

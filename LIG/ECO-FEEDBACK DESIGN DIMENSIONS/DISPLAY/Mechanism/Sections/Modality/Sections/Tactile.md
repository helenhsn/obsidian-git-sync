### Type of modality

##### Description
> Primary perceptual mode  (with [[Visual]] and [[Auditory]]) involving **touching** (on a screen, etc.) in order to attend the feedback.

> Experiential eco-feedback with [[Ambient]] and [[Auditory]] eco-feedback, as much as other types of feedback : [[tangible]], [[highly interactive]] and [[virtual reality]] displays.

> More popular in the context of eco-driving feedback since the driver has other visual priorities.

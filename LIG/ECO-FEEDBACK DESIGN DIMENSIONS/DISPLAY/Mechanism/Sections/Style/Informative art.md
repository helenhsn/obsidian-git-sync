### Type of style visualization

##### Description
> Visualisation style in between **artistic** and **pragmatic** visualizations. 

> Can be described as "**decorative**... **not immediately recognizable** as data-visualization" and "can be **integrated** more **long-term** withing the building environment".
> Can "easily be read to provide clear information, but after the user has recognized the display as a data-visualization and learned how to read it".

##### Notes
> Other research comparing **artistic** and **pragmatic** eco-visualizations suggests they complement each other. (Froehlich et al. : *participants desired numeric feedback in addition to iconic*)

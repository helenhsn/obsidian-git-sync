### Type of style visualization

##### Description
> Aims to **clearly communicate resource processes** via **scientific elements** (e.g. numbers, charts, graphs).
> 	This type of visualization can be **challenging** as many users "do not want to spend a lot of time reading text or interpreting graphs"

> Not much research on the **effectiveness** of different types of graphs, charts and numeric eco-feedback. **Map-based scientific data** visualizations are more engaging than **bar charts**.

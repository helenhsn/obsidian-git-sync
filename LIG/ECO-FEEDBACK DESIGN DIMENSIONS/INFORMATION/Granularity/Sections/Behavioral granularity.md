- *What behavior is being reflected in the eco-feedback?*

>[!DEFINITION]
>Behavioral granularity describes **whose**  behavior and **which** particular behavior(s) are **reflected** in the data, i.e.,  the target consumer(s) and target behavior(s). For example, some ecofeedback reflects the behavior of an individual (e.g., eco-driving feedback that reflects the driverâ€™s operation of the vehicle), whereas  other eco-feedback reflects the behavior of entire communities.

## Large vs Small scale
There is sometimes a **trade-off** whereby eco-feedback may focus on motivating a *large community* by reflecting collective  behavior and goals, but *lack precision* to support learning; **conversely**,  very personalized and granular eco-feedback may support individual  learning, but reach fewer consumers and be *unable to take full advantage  of social influence* strategies to motivate users.

#### Small scale granularity
Personnalized and focused granularity allow a better understanding (*learning*) and motivation from users.

**However**, if provided data is not large enough (eg. electricity consumption data -> Increased gas consumption), it can lead to opposite desired behaviours.

#### Large scale granularity
Large scale can use social influence to strengthen it's effects. It also touches a lot more people.
However, the learning is less effective and individual often less react.

### Behavioral granularity

###### Subsection of [[Granularity]]

> There is **sometimes** a trade-off whereby eco-feedback may focus on motivating a *large community* by reflecting collective  behavior and goals, but *lack precision* to support learning; conversely,  very personalized and granular eco-feedback may support individual  learning, but reach fewer consumers and be *unable to take full advantage  of social influence* strategies to motivate users.

#### Small scale granularity
Personnalized and focused granularity allow a better understanding (*learning*) and motivation from users.

**However**, if provided data is not large enough (eg. electricity consumption data -> Increased gas consumption), it can lead to opposite desired behaviours.

#### Large scale granularity
Large scale can use social influence to strengthen it's effects. It also touches a lot more people.

However, the learning is less effective and individual often less react.

##### Question related
- *Is the feedback being framed positively/negatively?*

> [!DEFINITION]
>Additionally, information may be **framed positively** or **negatively**, e.g., carbon dioxide emitted or offset, resources *saved*, *used*, or *wasted*; the **sign** of measurement units can also be considered valence

### Negative Valence
 **Negative valence** may be appropriate for ecofeedback to increase awareness of the consequences of consumption (which are negative), thereby increasing motivation via **moral/pro-environmental norm** ^79946f

The concept of [loss aversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion) in decision theory would **suggest** that **negative valence may be more effective**.

### Positive Valence
 On the other hand, behavior analytic principles might suggest that positively-framed feedback could more likely function as  **positive reinforcement**, creating a **better user experience**, whereas negatively framed feedback might be more aversive.

Valence **has not often been considered** in the eco-feedback literature. The authors have only found one study that investigated valence that found a **greater effect for positive points** feedback compared to negative  points in terms of **user engagement**.

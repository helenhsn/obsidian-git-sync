### Javier Hirschfeld Moreno's art

>[!Important]
>The following pictures from **Javier Hirschfeld Moreno** (a committed spanish artist currently living in London) aren't eco-feedback devices but are still interesting as they allow to spread a message among the viewers.

>[!Quote] What is data art ?
> Data Art or data-driven art is an artistic practice that relies on the usage of a dataset to convey emotions to the audience. Because it is based on data, the piece has a more objective truth behind its construction and does not solely come from the artist's imagination.

>[!Note]
> Wattsburning (the display in the pictures below) is an eco-feedback display using a video based animation of a forest site known by the household. Several elements of the landscape are changed (modified) based on the consumption of the household.

>- The electricity real time consumption is mapped as the movement of the clouds in the background, and by adding and removing animals in the landscape. 
>- The more a family consumes energy, the faster clouds will pass in the picture and the more appliances are turned on or off, the more there will be animals in the forest.

>Jetsam is a display exposing the waste inside a trash on the street, according to the time passing. This could be interesting in our case as we could use the same concept to exposer our amount of wifi used during the day in our bow or our mobile data according to time in a little box in our house.

>The following displays are showing artificial life (a-life) populations that are linked directly to consumption and are visualized using real-time fluid dynamics on an ambient display. No study has been done to prove the efficacity of this visualization, though. But it could be extended to the numerical domain (we would need to define a new behavior of the a-life regarding a particular domain of numeric consumption, for example regarding our amount of personal mobile data...)

### Audio

>[!Note]
Audio visualization can be a great way to transmit information. With audio, it is possible to perceive variations in frequency and intensity. 
There are others degrees of freedom such as the pitch and the tone of the audio to play with. 
However, it is apparently hard to make something that is both pleasant to hear and understandable.

### Text

>[!Note]
>Some AI have been trained on different datasets in order to give those a "personality". They then generated some text. AI are getting better at text generation. [Models for environmental literacy](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3450507.3457439)
>It is also possible to generate with an [AI not specificly trained on numeric consumption](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) to write poems for instance such as :

![[poem1.png]]
![[poem2.png]]

>[!Note]
> AI is interesting for this application because it can create many visualizations with varied styles and artistic representations. It can produce personalized prompts for each user which could be efficient in fighting the user's diminishing interest and attention.

### Coupled devices

>[!Note]
>- Some devices could work great if coupled. For instance, this device where you store object for a fixed amount of time in order to prevent their usage with a map of smartphone moves in the household. It can help evaluate the efficiency of a device free area. 
>- Also if users have decided not to use their devices in a specific room, this display is also sensitive to this kind of situation.
>- An interesting information to use would be a map where devices have been activated (screen turned on) or even a density map that shows how long devices have been use at a place.

## 2. Data Visualization displays

>[!Note]
Some fields such as data visualization are more common and advanced than data-driven art but are closely related. The strength of data visualisation is that it is made to interpret and put emphasis on some phenomenum in the flow of data.

### Organizational charts

>[!Note]
The following visualization doesn't represent any energy conumption but rather expose an organisational chart of a company. This type of visualization is still interesting though as it could be used to keep track of what we're doing on the internet. For example, it could show the tree of videos we're following on youtube, or the links we're following on internet... The bigger the tree is, the bigger our activity could be, for example.

### Streaming consumption

>[!Note]
>We noticed that there are a lot of visualization regarding binge watching, eventhough they tend to raise the population's awareness on digital wellbeing and not on the numeric consumption. Still, these type of visualizations can be useful in our case as they became larger, more condensed as the household increase its consumption.

### Internet usage
>[!Note]
>Cloudflare is a tool that provide internet optimization, security. Such a tool is capabled of producing data visualizations of internet usage patterns in inner cities, which is interesting in our case. For example, the picture below showing the internet usage in London can be extended to the case of a household, by showing the rooms were the usage is the highest, the lowest, etc.

### The work of Kirell Benzi
>[!Note]
It is worth looking at [Kirell Benzi's work](https://www.kirellbenzi.com/) at the edge between data art and data visualization. He participated in the making of several fascinating data-driven art work. Examples of his work are following.

## 3. Other type of displays

### Games

>[!Note]
>We found this type of display interesting as it doesn't represent our real consumption but depict quite well our consuming behavior and how it can be improved regarding to reduce our carbon footprint. This display is actually **a game**, named **The Power House** (*PowerHaus*). The player has to take care of the chores in a household (this is more or less a game that looks a lot like Sims games...). By doing so, the game will suggest few improvements to reduce the player's consumption in the household.

# Conclusion

## What type of displays are actually effective ?

>[!Note]
>[WATTSBurning](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01497454/document) is the display with the most assessment. To study the effectiveness of the display, the team tested its usage on six households and analyzed their consumption and interaction for a total of 17 weeks. Several questions were asked by the team.
>Regarding qualitative assessment:
>- **1) if energy aware mode of the application was well understood by the families** -> all the families found it **easy to relate their current consumption** with the animation. Although users didn’t mention an emotional connection with the illustrated forest landscape, the energy awareness mode, where the forest dries up as more energy is consumed, did work as an alert for when consumption was higher than normal. Some users even found the forest on fire for a long time a disturbing factor that would motivate them to investigate which appliances were responsible for the higher level of consumption.
>- **2) where the display was placed in the house**.  -> all the families opted to place the system **in a central sace in the house**, where **it could be visible to all the members**. Sometimes the display was moved by the users (kitchen, balcony) to explore the consumption of different appliances.

>[!Important]
>**What about the relapse effect?** : the last eco-feedback devices of the team led to a decreasing interest  for eco-feedback after several weeks.
>This time, the team improved their eco-feedback system introducing a new artistic metaphor that combines energy consumption levels to artistic representations of the local forest landscape.
>Results :
>- Most families kept using the system even after four to five weeks, although to a lesser extent.
>- The placement of the eco-feedback device and the presence of an energy awareness mode showing the landscape changing was an important motivator to retain user attention and awareness over time.

### Factors that lead to relapse behavior (source : Wattsburning)

- **Receiving timely feedback is key to motivating behavior change :** when energy consumption savings don't happen, it may be because the eco-feedback is displayed too infrequently (monthly) and hence was disconnected from the consumption behavior. It is possible to see that users gradually return to their previous behaviors if feedback is less frequent or no longer present. This larck of attention starts to happen after the fourth week of usage, usually.

- **The single goal of saving money** (less electricity you consume the less you pay), **is not enough to motivate** conspicuous behavior change. The authors propose **eight qualities** that a system should have in order to be **well accepted by users**: Abstract & Reflective, Unobtrusive, Public, Aesthetic, Positive, Controllable, Trending / Historical and Comprehensive -> non-traditional feedback systems.

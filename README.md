#obsidian-git-sync

## Description

This repository was created to share my research work with my tutor at the Laboratory of Informatics at Grenoble (LIG).
This work consisted in searching for the transposition of nudges from a domain to another, especially to the digital domain. We've decided to use **Obsidian** as a medium to display my research and findings (the graph view is very useful to display the salience of particular files and their link with other files).


## Prerequisite

You'll need to install **Obsidian** if you want to have a better visualization of the files' hierarchy.

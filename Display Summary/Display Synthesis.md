# Tangible Interface
## Interactive display
>[!Note]
>This display is reactive to how users are close to it. Allowing more interactions than a simple display.

# Type of displays

## 1. Artistic diplays
>[!Quote] What is data art ?
> Data Art or data-driven art is an artistic practice that relies on the usage of a dataset to convey emotions to the audience. Because it is based on data, the piece has a more objective truth behind its construction and does not solely come from the artist's imagination.

>[!Note]
> Wattsburning (the display in the pictures below) is an eco-feedback display using a video based animation of a forest site known by the household. Several elements of the landscape are changed (modified) based on the consumption of the household.

 [Timelapse of the application 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=6&v=ABkf9tw9-Z0&feature=emb_logo)
>- The electricity real time consumption is mapped as the movement of the clouds in the background, and by adding and removing animals in the landscape. 
>- The more a family consumes energy, the faster clouds will pass in the picture and the more appliances are turned on or off, the more there will be animals in the forest.

>[!Note]
>The following displays are showing artificial life (a-life) populations that are linked directly to consumption and are visualized using real-time fluid dynamics on an ambient display. No study has been done to prove the efficacity of this visualization, though. But it could be extended to the numerical domain (we would need to define a new behavior of the a-life regarding a particular domain of numeric consumption, for example regarding our amount of personal mobile data...)

### Audio

>[!Note]
Audio visualization can be a great way to transmit information. With audio, it is possible to perceive variations in frequency and intensity. 
There are others degrees of freedom such as the pitch and the tone of the audio to play with. 
However, it is apparently hard to make something that is both pleasant to hear and understandable.

### Text

>[!Note]
>Some AI have been trained on different datasets in order to give those a "personality". They then generated some text. AI are getting better at text generation. [Models for environmental literacy](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3450507.3457439)
>It is also possible to generate with an [AI not specificly trained on numeric consumption](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) to write poems for instance such as :

![[poem1.png]]
![[poem2.png]]

>[!Note]
> AI is interesting for this application because it can create many visualizations with varied styles and artistic representations. It can produce personalized prompts for each user which could be efficient in fighting the user's diminishing interest and attention.

### Coupled devices

>[!Note]
>- Some devices could work great if coupled. For instance, this device where you store object for a fixed amount of time in order to prevent their usage with a map of smartphone moves in the household. It can help evaluate the efficiency of a device free area. 
>- Also if users have decided not to use their devices in a specific room, this display is also sensitive to this kind of situation.
>- An interesting information to use would be a map where devices have been activated (screen turned on) or even a density map that shows how long devices have been use at a place.

## 2. Data Visualization displays

>[!Note]
Some fields such as data visualization are more common and advanced than data-driven art but are closely related. The strength of data visualisation is that it is made to interpret and put emphasis on some phenomenum in the flow of data.

### Use in organizational charts

>[!Note]
The following visualization doesn't represent any energy conumption but rather expose an organisational chart of a company. This type of visualization is still interesting though as it could be used to keep track of what we're doing on the internet. For example, it could show the tree of videos we're following on youtube, or the links we're following on internet... The bigger the tree is, the bigger our activity could be, for example.

### The work of Kirell Benzi
>[!Note]
It is worth looking at [Kirell Benzi's work](https://www.kirellbenzi.com/) at the edge between data art and data visualization. He participated in the making of several fascinating data-driven art work. Examples of his work are following.

>[!Quote] 
> This artwork shows 1 day of email exchanges between all employees of a Swiss company and the outside world where each dot is either an employee or an external correspondant. Colored by business units, we can clearly see that the flow of information is well distributed across the different branches.

## 3. Other type of displays

### Games

>[!Note]
>We found this type of display interesting as it doesn't represent our real consumption but depict quite well our consuming behavior and how it can be improved regarding to reduce our carbon footprint. This display is actually **a game**, named **The Power House** (*PowerHaus*). The player has to take care of the chores in a household (this is more or less a game that looks a lot like Sims games...). By doing so, the game will suggest few improvements to reduce the player's consumption in the household.

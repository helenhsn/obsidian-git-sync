# Tangible Interface
## Interactive display
This display is reactive to how users are close to it. Allowing more interactions than a simple display.

## Artistic diplay
>[!Quote] What is data art ?
> Data Art or data-driven art is an artistic practice that relies on the usage of a dataset to convey emotions to the audience. Because it is based on data, the piece has a more objective truth behind its construction and does not solely come from the artist's imagination.

[Elements of Consumption: an abstract visualization of household consumption](http://makonin.com/doc/SG_2011.pdf)
One could replace Electricity, Water and Natural Gas with some numeric usage relevant quantities.

Those visualizations are applied to energy consumption but could be applied to numeric consumption. 

### Audio "visualization"
Audio visualization can be a great way to transmit information. With audio, it is possible to perceive variations in frequency and intensity. 
There are others degrees of freedom such as the pitch and the tone of the audio to play with. 
However, it is apparently hard to make something that is both pleasant to hear and understandable.

### Text "visualization"
Some AI have been trained on different datasets in order to give those a "personality". They then generated some text.  
[Models for environmental literacy](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3450507.3457439)
AI are getting better at text generation. It is possible to generate with an [AI not specificly trained on numeric consumption](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) to write poems for instance such as :

>[!Note]
> AI is interesting for this application because it can create many visualizations with varied styles and artistic representations. It can produce personalized prompts for each user which could be efficient in fighting the user's diminishing interest and attention.

### Coupled devices
Some devices could work great if coupled. For instance, this device where you store object for a fixed amount of time in order to prevent their usage with a map of smartphone moves in the household. It can help evaluate the efficiency of a device free area.
Also if users have decided not to use their devices in a specific room, this display is also sensitive to this kind of situation.
An interesting information to use would be a map where devices have been activated (screen turned on) or even a density map that shows how long devices have been use at a place.

## Data Visualisation display

Some fields such as data visualization are more common and advanced than data-driven art but are closely related. The strength of data visualisation is that it is made to interpret and put emphasis on some phenomenum in the flow of data. However, the most  that The art side of it fades more or less 

Not an eco-feedback display but interesting -> could be made to track our video streaming path on youtube ?

It is worth looking at [Kirell Benzi's work](https://www.kirellbenzi.com/) at the edge between data art and data visualization. He participated in the making of several fascinating data-driven art work such as :

Colored by business units, we can clearly see that the flow of information is well distributed across the different branches.
